# NFDI Core Ontology

This is version v1.1.0 of the NFDIcore ontology.

A documentation can be found at the [GitHub page](https://ise-fizkarlsruhe.github.io/nfdicore/).

The NFDIcore ontology describes all resouces (datasets, data providers, persons, projects and other entities) in the data domain of [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/). It serves as the basis for further domain specific ontologies, e.g. [nfdi4culture ontology](https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/nfdi4culture-ontology), nfdi4matwerk ontology. Mappings to numerous external vocabularies and further ontologies are provided (see mappings directory).
