# NFDI Core Ontology

## Introduction

The [National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)](https://www.nfdi.de/) initiative has led to the formation of various consortia, each focused on developing a research data infrastructure tailored to its specific domain. To ensure interoperability across these consortia, the NFDIcore ontology has been developed as a mid-level ontology for representing metadata related to NFDI resources, including individuals, organizations, projects, data portals, and more.


Recognizing the diverse needs of consortia, NFDIcore is built upon the [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://basic-formal-ontology.org/), a foundational framework essential for enhancing knowledge representation, data exchange, and interdisciplinary collaboration. To address domain-specific research questions, NFDIcore serves as the basis for various application and domain ontologies, which extend its core structure in a modular fashion.
Examples include the [NFDI4Culture Ontology (CTO)](https://gitlab.rlp.net/adwmainz/nfdi4culture/knowledge-graph/culture-ontology), [NFDI MatWerk Ontology (MWO)](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/nfdi-matwerk/ta-oms/mwo),  [NFDI4Memory Ontology (MEMO)](https://nfdi.fiz-karlsruhe.de/4memory/), and [NFDI4DataScience Ontology (DSO)](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/services/4dsontology_d/), each tailored to specific research fields while ensuring semantic interoperability.

As a mid-level ontology, NFDIcore plays a central role in structuring and integrating research data across consortia. It provides a shared vocabulary that represents both the organizational structure of the Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur (NFDI) and the diverse datasets contributed by project partners. The ontology encompasses key concepts such as organizations, consortia, projects, datasets, research outputs, geographical locations, and technical standards. These structured representations enable efficient data management, integration, and reuse across disciplines.

NFDIcore focuses on describing the following main concepts:

- **Organizational & Research Structure** â€“ Represents institutions, consortia, projects, researchers, and their roles within NFDI.  
- **Data & Information Management** â€“ Covers datasets, data portals, collections, publications, and intellectual outputs to support research.  
- **Geographical & Contextual Information** â€“ Includes cities, countries, and regions relevant to NFDI activities.  
- **Technology & Standards** â€“ Encompasses software, programming languages, specifications, standards, and ontologies for interoperability.  
- **Services & Licensing** â€“ Defines resources, service processes, licenses, and web-based platforms supporting data sharing and collaboration.

## Get in contact with the NFDIcore Team

Every Thursday at 10:00 the NFDIcore team meets and discusses the development of the ontology and its extensions in the NFDIcore Playground. Questions about specific modeling decisions can be discussed in the NFDIcore [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/nfdicore/discussions). [Github issues](https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/nfdicore/issues) can be used to report errors or to request additional classes and properties. For general questions about NFDIcore and for participation in the Playground, please email [Tabea Tietz](mailto:tabea.tietz@fiz-karlsruhe.de).

## Conferences and Events 

The NFDIcore team can frequently be found at Semantic Web and AI conferences and Research Data Management events. Feel free to find us there and talk to us.
