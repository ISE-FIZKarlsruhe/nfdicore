# NFDI Core Ontology

This serves as the base ontology on which we will build other more NFDI specific ontologies. As a start we have [NFDI4Culture](https://gitlab.com/nfdi4culture/ta5-knowledge-graph/ontology) and [Matwerk](https://link_to_follow.example). This process will serve as an investigation to see if we can build others upon this shared base.
