# NFDI core ontology

Welcome to the documentation page for our ontology developed within the framework of the [National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) initiative](https://www.nfdi.de/). The NFDI initiative is dedicated to making scientific and research data available, interconnected, and sustainable for long-term use.

The NFDI brings together institutions from various research disciplines to collaborate on essential services, training opportunities for researchers, and the development of standards for data management. The overarching vision of NFDI is to treat data as a shared asset for excellent research, managed by the scientific community in Germany.

The NFDIcore ontology captures both the structure of the NFDI organization and the diverse datasets provided by NFDI project partners. As a mid-level ontology, it bridges high-level concepts with more specific domain ontologies, ensuring both flexibility and consistency in representing and managing research data.
