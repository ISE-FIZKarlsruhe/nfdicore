# NFDI Core Ontology

This is version v1.0.1 of the NFDIcore ontology.


The NFDIcore ontology describes all resouces (datasets, data providers, persons, projects and other entities) in the data domain of [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/). It serves as the basis for further domain specific ontologies, e.g. [nfdi4culture ontology](https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/nfdi4culture-ontology), nfdi4matwerk ontology, and contains mappings (cf. nfdico_with_mappings.ttl) to numerous external vocabularies and further ontologies.
