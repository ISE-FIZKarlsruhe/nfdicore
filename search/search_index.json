Class Hierarchy The image below illustrates the top-level hierarchy of the ontology (Version 3.0.0). Most NFDIcore classes have been defined as subclasses of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), Information Artifact Ontology (IAO), or the Software Ontology (SWO). Since BFO 2020 \u2014 the version currently adopted by NFDIcore \u2014 is not fully supported by IAO, some relevant IAO concepts could not be reused. In such cases, NFDIcore-specific classes have been introduced, such as dataset, document and identifier. BFO as top level ontology The Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a top-level ontology that provides a structured framework for organizing entities based on their fundamental nature. It does not include domain-specific content but instead defines high-level categories that support the development of specialized ontologies like NFDIcore. BFO distinguishes entities based on whether they persist through time or unfold over time, dividing them into continuants and occurrents (see image above). Continuants (Endurants) Continuants are entities that exist at any given moment in time and maintain their identity over time. There are tree kinds of continuants: independent continuants, generically dependent continuants and specifically dependent continuants. Independent Continuants (IC) These are entities that exist independently and do not require another entity to exist. Material Entities \u2013 Physical objects with spatial extension. Examples : Organisms, buildings, tools. Immaterial Entities \u2013 Boundaries or parts of objects defined by human convention. Examples : The equator, the upper half of a sphere. Generically Dependent Continuants (GDC) These entities depend on independent continuants for their existence. Generically dependent continuants can exist in multiple instances or be replicated across different locations. Examples : A book\u2019s content (as opposed to a single physical copy of the book) A software program (which can be installed on multiple computers) A musical composition (which can be played on different instruments) A dataset and data items Entities with information content Specifically Dependent Continuants (SDC) Specifically dependent continuants are qualities, roles, or dispositions that exist only in relation to a particular independent continuant . They cannot exist independently and must always be inherent in something else . Qualities - Intrinsic properties of an independent continuant. They describe how an entity is at any moment in time. Examples : The color of a leaf, the weight of a person, the temperature of a liquid. Roles - Situational properties that an entity has based on context or social convention . Examples : The role of a teacher, he status of a patient in a hospital, the role of a machine undergoing maintenance. Dispositions and functions - Potential behaviors or tendencies that an entity has, even if they are not currently being realized. Functions are dispositions that represent the particular purpose of something. Examples : The fragility of glass (it might break if dropped), the solubility of salt (it dissolves in water), a person\u2019s ability to speak multiple languages, the function of an oven to heat something up, the function of a screwdriver to turn screws in and out. Occurrents (Perdurants) An occurrents is an entity that unfolds itself in time or it is the start or end of such an entity. Processes Processes are dynamic activities with temporal duration. Examples : A running event, a chemical reaction, cell division. Temporal Regions These represent divisions of time. Examples : A second, an hour, a historical period. Spatiotemporal Regions These combine space and time into a single entity. Examples : The path of a moving object, the trajectory of a planet. Relations in BFO BFO defines formal relationships between entities to maintain consistency. Some key relations include: continunat part of \u2013 Indicates compositional relationships. ( Example: A wheel is part of a car. ) occurent part of - Some process has another process as part. ( Example: A conference event has multiple workshop events. ) located in \u2013 Specifies spatial containment. ( Example: A book is located_in a library. ) bearer of \u2013 Assigns specifically dependent continuants to independent continuants. ( Example: A teacher is the bearer of the educator role. ) has participant - Assigns continuants to processes. ( Example: A student participates a lecture event. ) More information about BFO can be found at the GitHub repo and the documentation page .","title":"Ontology"},{"location":"ontology/#ontology","text":"The NFDI Ontology is a mid-level ontology designed to represent both the organizational structure of the Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur (NFDI) and the diverse datasets provided by NFDI project partners.","title":"Ontology"},{"location":"ontology/#overview","text":"The ontology provides a shared vocabulary and a consistent framework that supports data management, integration, and interoperability across a wide range of disciplines.

Agents Likewise, in NFDIcore, the concept of Agents extends to both organizations and persons, serving as independent continuants within the BFO ontology. Agents are essential for management of research data resources, and include entities such as research institutions, consortia, universities, companies, and individual researchers or data scientists. Within NFDIcore, agents can be directly linked to resources via different relations; may participate in processes (BFO_0000015) and be associated with diverse roles (BFO_0000023), e.g. nfdicore:publisher role (NFDI_0000193), nfdicore:contributor role (NFDI_0000118), etc. within the processes. Moreover, agents engage in diverse relationships with other agents, e.g. nfdicore:parent organization (NFDI_0000182). Resources within NFDIcore engage in diverse relationships with agents, facilitated by various properties such as nfdicore:contributor, nfdicore:creator, nfdicore:publisher, and nfdicore:contactPoint. While these properties enable direct connections between agents and resources, they may lack some expressivity. E.g. additional information about the relationship like a temporal context, ordering (e.g. for authors). In scenarios requiring more detailed semantics to describe the relationship between an agent and a resource, the modeling proposed by BFO 2020 with processes and roles can be employed. Processes A process (BFO_0000015) can encompass subordinate processes and partial processes. Within NFDIcore, a process often serves to establish connections between agents and information content entities (IAO_0000030), defining the roles (BFO_0000023) of agents with respect to the involved information content entities. Events and Time The bfo:temporal region (BFO_0000008) is an occurrent and is used to represent the structure of time. Thereby, the bfo:zero-dimensional temporal region (BFO_0000148) represents a single instant in time, a precise point in time without any duration, e.g. the date when the NFDI Verein was founded (nfdicore:act of foundation, NFDI_0001020). In contrast, the one-dimensional temporal region (BFO_0000038) refers to a time interval which has a duration, can be finite as well as infinite and events can occur within it. The nfdicore:event (NFDI_0000131) is associated with processes that represent an organized happening that unfolds in time. The nfdicore:event, classified as an occurrent (BFO_0000003), serves as a representation for various happenings such as conferences, and workshops.","title":"Patterns"},{"location":"patterns/#usage-patterns","text":"In this section usage patterns and A-Box examples are introduced.","title":"Usage Patterns"},{"location":"patterns/#nfdi-resources","text":"Within NFDIcore, resources are continuants which encompass a wide range of digital creative works, including datasets, collections, and metadata, as well as offered products and services such as data portals, data curation, and data digitization. stateDiagram direction BT #style definitions classDef clazz fill:lightgrey,color:white classDef individual font-size:small #styling of classes class bfo_occurrent clazz class bfo_entity clazz class bfo_continuant clazz #relations bfo_occurrent --> bfo_entity: subClassOf # bfo_continuant --> bfo_entity: subClassOf # bfo_process --> bfo_occurrent: subClassOf # bfo_temporal_region --> bfo_occurrent: subClassOf # bfo_one_dimensional --> bfo_temporal_region: subClassOf # bfo_two_dimensional --> bfo_temporal_region: subClassOf var mermaidConfig = { startOnLoad: false, theme: \"base\", fontFamily: \"Inter, system-ui, sans-serif\", themeVariables: { background: \"#f3f7f8\", primaryColor: \"#e6eef2\", primaryBorderColor: \"#134f5c\", primaryTextColor: \"#0b1320\", lineColor: \"#134f5c\", tertiaryColor: \"#ec941c\", edgeLabelBackground: \"#ffffff\", fontSize: \"14px\" } }; // optional, but harmless window.mermaidConfig = mermaidConfig; stateDiagram direction BT classDef clazz fill:lightgrey,color:white; state \"cto:CTO_0001005 (source item)\" as CTO_SourceItem class CTO_SourceItem clazz state \"nfdicore:NFDI_0000003 (organization)\" as NFDI_organization class NFDI_organization clazz state \"schema:DataFeed\" as SCHEMA_DataFeed class SCHEMA_DataFeed clazz state \"cto:CTO_0001024 (incipit)\" as CTO_Incipit class CTO_Incipit clazz state \"RISM Online\" as org_rism state \"E5313\" as feed_e5313 state \"RISM Resource 201001959\" as si_201001959 state \"201001959 incipit 1.1.1\" as inc_1_1_1 state \"A''C/'B''D'BA/2G4BA/G-B''D/G4-2-/\" as PATTERN_CLASS class PATTERN_CLASS state \"C/\" as TIMESIG class TIMESIG org_rism --> NFDI_organization:a si_201001959 --> CTO_SourceItem:a inc_1_1_1 --> CTO_Incipit:a feed_e5313 --> SCHEMA_DataFeed:a si_201001959 --> inc_1_1_1:CTO_has incipit si_201001959 --> org_rism: NFDI_publishedBy si_201001959 --> feed_e5313:CTO_isReferencedIn inc_1_1_1 --> PATTERN_CLASS:CTO_hasPattern inc_1_1_1 --> key_G:CTO_hasKey inc_1_1_1 --> clef_C1:CTO_hasClef inc_1_1_1 --> keysig_xF:CTO_hasKeySignature inc_1_1_1 --> TIMESIG:CTO_hasIncipitTimeSignature class RISM_201001959 class RISM_inc_1_1_1 class RISM-online class E5313 class G class C1 state \"xF\" as keysig_xF NFDI resources can be associated with academic disciplines (nfdicore:academic discipline, NFDI_0000100) allowing for a more nuanced understanding of their context and relevance.","title":"NFDI Resources"},{"location":"patterns/#agents","text":"Likewise, in NFDIcore, the concept of Agents extends to both organizations and persons, serving as independent continuants within the BFO ontology.

There are a few different editors workflows: Local editing workflow: Editing the ontology in your local environment by hand, using tools such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, ROBOT templates or DOSDP patterns. Completely automated data pipeline (GitHub Actions) DROID workflow This document only covers the first editing workflow, but more will be added in the future Local editing workflow Workflow requirements: git github docker editing tool of choice, e.g. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, your favourite text editor, etc 1. Create issue Ensure that there is a ticket on your issue tracker that describes the change you are about to make. While this seems optional, this is a very important part of the social contract of building an ontology - no change to the ontology should be performed without a good ticket, describing the motivation and nature of the intended change. 2. Update main branch In your local environment (e.g. your laptop), make sure you are on the main (prev. master ) branch and ensure that you have all the upstream changes, for example: git checkout main git pull 3. Create feature branch Create a new branch. Per convention, we try to use meaningful branch names such as: - issue23removeprocess (where issue 23 is the related issue on GitHub) - issue26addcontributor - release20210101 (for releases) On your command line, this looks like this: git checkout -b issue23removeprocess 4. Perform edit Using your editor of choice, perform the intended edit. For example: Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Open src/ontology/nfdicore-edit.owl in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Make the change Save the file TextEdit Open src/ontology/nfdicore-edit.owl in TextEdit (or Sublime, Atom, Vim, Nano) Make the change Save the file Consider the following when making the edit. According to our development philosophy, the only places that should be manually edited are: src/ontology/nfdicore-edit.owl Any ROBOT templates you chose to use (the TSV files only) Any DOSDP data tables you chose to use (the TSV files, and potentially the associated patterns) components (anything in src/ontology/components ), see here . Imports should not be edited (any edits will be flushed out with the next update). However, refreshing imports is a potentially breaking change - and is discussed elsewhere . Changes should usually be small. Adding or changing 1 term is great. Adding or changing 10 related terms is ok. Adding or changing 100 or more terms at once should be considered very carefully. 4. Check the Git diff This step is very important. Rather than simply trusting your change had the intended effect, we should always use a git diff as a first pass for sanity checking. In our experience, having a visual git client like GitHub Desktop or sourcetree is really helpful for this part. In case you prefer the command line: git status git diff 5. Quality control Now it's time to run your quality control checks. This can either happen locally ( 5a ) or through your continuous integration system ( 7/5b ). 5a. Local testing If you chose to run your test locally: sh run.sh make IMP=false test This will run the whole set of configured ODK tests on including your change. If you have a complex DOSDP pattern pipeline you may want to add PAT=false to skip the potentially lengthy process of rebuilding the patterns. sh run.sh make IMP=false PAT=false test 6. Pull request When you are happy with the changes, you commit your changes to your feature branch, push them upstream (to GitHub) and create a pull request. For example: git add NAMEOFCHANGEDFILES git commit -m \"Added biological process term #12\" git push -u origin issue23removeprocess Then you go to your project on GitHub, and create a new pull request from the branch, for example: https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pulls There is a lot of great advise on how to write pull requests, but at the very least you should: - mention the tickets affected: see #23 to link to a related ticket, or fixes #23 if, by merging this pull request, the ticket is fixed. Tickets in the latter case will be closed automatically by GitHub when the pull request is merged. - summarise the changes in a few sentences. Consider the reviewer: what would they want to know right away. - If the diff is large, provide instructions on how to review the pull request best (sometimes, there are many changed files, but only one important change). 7/5b. Continuous Integration Testing If you didn't run and local quality control checks (see 5a ), you should have Continuous Integration (CI) set up, for example: - Travis - GitHub Actions More on how to set this up here . Once the pull request is created, the CI will automatically trigger. If all is fine, it will show up green, otherwise red. 8. Community review Once all the automatic tests have passed, it is important to put a second set of eyes on the pull request. Ontologies are inherently social - as in that they represent some kind of community consensus on how a domain is organised conceptually. This seems high brow talk, but it is very important that as an ontology editor, you have your work validated by the community you are trying to serve (e.g. your colleagues, other contributors etc.). In our experience, it is hard to get more than one review on a pull request - two is great. You can set up GitHub branch protection to actually require a review before a pull request can be merged! We recommend this. This step seems daunting to some hopefully under-resourced ontologies, but we recommend to put this high up on your list of priorities - train a colleague, reach out! 9. Merge and cleanup When the QC is green and the reviews are in (approvals), it is time to merge the pull request. After the pull request is merged, remember to delete the branch as well (this option will show up as a big button right after you have merged the pull request). If you have not done so, close all the associated tickets fixed by the pull request. 10. Changelog (Optional) It is sometimes difficult to keep track of changes made to an ontology.

Run a release with the ODK Preparation: Ensure that all your pull requests are merged into your main (master) branch Make sure that all changes to main are committed to GitHub ( git status should say that there are no modified files) Locally make sure you have the latest changes from main ( git pull ) Checkout a new branch (e.g. git checkout -b release-2021-01-01 ) You may or may not want to refresh your imports as part of your release strategy (see here ) Make sure you have the latest ODK installed by running docker pull obolibrary/odkfull To actually run the release, you: Open a command line terminal window and navigate to the src/ontology directory ( cd nfdicore/src/ontology ) Run release pipeline: sh run.sh make prepare_release -B . Note that for some ontologies, this process can take up to 90 minutes - especially if there are large ontologies you depend on, like PRO or CHEBI. If everything went well, you should see the following output on your machine: Release files are now in ../.. - now you should commit, push and make a release on your git hosting site such as GitHub or GitLab . This will create all the specified release targets (OBO, OWL, JSON, and the variants, ont-full and ont-base) and copy them into your release directory (the top level of your repo). Review the release (Optional) Rough check. This step is frequently skipped, but for the more paranoid among us (like the author of this doc), this is a 3 minute additional effort for some peace of mind. Open the main release (nfdicore.owl) in you favourite development environment (i.e. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9) and eyeball the hierarchy. We recommend two simple checks: Does the very top level of the hierarchy look ok? This means that all new terms have been imported/updated correctly. Does at least one change that you know should be in this release appear? For example, a new class. This means that the release was actually based on the recent edit file. Commit your changes to the branch and make a pull request In your GitHub pull request, review the following three files in detail (based on our experience): nfdicore.obo - this reflects a useful subset of the whole ontology (everything that can be covered by OBO format). OBO format has that speaking for it: it is very easy to review! nfdicore-base.owl - this reflects the asserted axioms in your ontology that you have actually edited. Ideally also take a look at nfdicore-full.owl , which may reveal interesting new inferences you did not know about. Note that the diff of this file is sometimes quite large. Like with every pull request, we recommend to always employ a second set of eyes when reviewing a PR! Merge the main branch Once your CI checks have passed, and your reviews are completed, you can now merge the branch into your main branch (don't forget to delete the branch afterwards - a big button will appear after the merge is finished). Create a GitHub release Go to your releases page on GitHub by navigating to your repository, and then clicking on releases (usually on the right, for example: https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/nfdicore/releases). Then click \"Draft new release\" As the tag version you need to choose the date on which your ontologies were build. You can find this, for example, by looking at the nfdicore.obo file and check the data-version: property. The date needs to be prefixed with a v , so, for example v2020-02-06 . You can write whatever you want in the release title, but we typically write the date again. The description underneath should contain a concise list of changes or term additions.

When you see error messages relating to large ontologies such as CHEBI, PRO, NCBITAXON, or Uberon, you should think of memory first, see here . Problems when using OBO format based tools Sometimes you will get cryptic error messages when using legacy tools using OBO format, such as the ontology release tool (OORT), which is also available as part of the ODK docker container. In these cases, you need to track down what axiom or annotation actually caused the breakdown. In our experience (in about 60% of the cases) the problem lies with duplicate annotations ( def , comment ) which are illegal in OBO. Here is an example recipe of how to deal with such a problem: If you get a message like make: *** [cl.Makefile:84: oort] Error 255 you might have a OORT error. To debug this, in your terminal enter sh run.sh make IMP=false PAT=false oort -B (assuming you are already in the ontology folder in your directory) This should show you where the error is in the log (eg multiple different definitions) WARNING: THE FIX BELOW IS NOT IDEAL, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO FIX UPSTREAM IF POSSIBLE Open nfdicore-edit.owl in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and find the offending term and delete all offending issue (e.g. delete ALL definition, if the problem was \"multiple def tags not allowed\") and save. *While this is not idea, as it will remove all definitions from that term, it will be added back again when the term is fixed in the ontology it was imported from and added back in.

The ODK Project Configuration Schema defines all possible parameters that can be used in this config YAML. Once you have made your changes, you can run the following to apply your changes to the repository: sh run.sh make update_repo There are a large number of options that can be set to configure your ODK, but we will only discuss a few of them here. NOTE for Windows users: You may get a cryptic failure such as Set Illegal Option - if the update script located in src/scripts/update_repo.sh was saved using Windows Line endings. These need to change to unix line endings. In Notepad++, for example, you can click on Edit->EOL Conversion->Unix LF to change this. Managing imports You can use the update repository workflow described on this page to perform the following operations to your imports: Add a new import Modify an existing import Remove an import you no longer want Customise an import We will discuss all these workflows in the following. Add new import To add a new import, you first edit your odk config as described above , adding an id to the product list in the import_group section (for the sake of this example, we assume you already import RO, and your goal is to also import GO): import_group: products: - id: ro - id: go Note: our ODK file should only have one import_group which can contain multiple imports (in the products section). Next, you run the update repo workflow to apply these changes. Note that by default, this module is going to be a SLME Bottom module, see here . To change that or customise your module, see section \"Customise an import\". To finalise the addition of your import, perform the following steps: Add an import statement to your src/ontology/nfdicore-edit.owl file. We suggest to do this using a text editor, by simply copying an existing import declaration and renaming it to the new ontology import, for example as follows: ... Ontology(<https://nfdi.fiz-karlsruhe.de/ontology/nfdicore.owl> Import(<https://nfdi.fiz-karlsruhe.de/ontology/nfdicore/imports/ro_import.owl>) Import(<https://nfdi.fiz-karlsruhe.de/ontology/nfdicore/imports/go_import.owl>) ... Add your imports redirect to your catalog file src/ontology/catalog-v001.xml , for example: <uri name=\"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/nfdicore/imports/go_import.owl\" uri=\"imports/go_import.owl\"/> Test whether everything is in order: Refresh your import Open in your Ontology Editor of choice (Protege) and ensure that the expected terms are imported. Note: The catalog file src/ontology/catalog-v001.xml has one purpose: redirecting imports from URLs to local files. For example, if you have Import(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/nfdicore/imports/go_import.owl>) in your editors file (the ontology) and <uri name=\"https://nfdi.fiz-karlsruhe.de/ontology/nfdicore/imports/go_import.owl\" uri=\"imports/go_import.owl\"/> in your catalog, tools like robot or Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 will recognize the statement in the catalog file to redirect the URL http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/nfdicore/imports/go_import.owl to the local file imports/go_import.owl (which is in your src/ontology directory). Modify an existing import If you simply wish to refresh your import in light of new terms, see here . If you wish to change the type of your module see section \"Customise an import\". Remove an existing import To remove an existing import, perform the following steps: remove the import declaration from your src/ontology/nfdicore-edit.owl . remove the id from your src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml , eg. - id: go from the list of products in the import_group . run update repo workflow delete the associated files manually: src/imports/go_import.owl src/imports/go_terms.txt Remove the respective entry from the src/ontology/catalog-v001.xml file. Customise an import By default, an import module extracted from a source ontology will be a SLME module, see here . There are various options to change the default. The following change to your repo config ( src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml ) will switch the go import from an SLME module to a simple ROBOT filter module: import_group: products: - id: ro - id: go module_type: filter A ROBOT filter module is, essentially, importing all external terms declared by your ontology (see here on how to declare external terms to be imported). Note that the filter module does not consider terms/annotations from namespaces other than the base-namespace of the ontology itself. For example, in the example of GO above, only annotations / axioms related to the GO base IRI (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_) would be considered. This behaviour can be changed by adding additional base IRIs as follows: import_group: products: - id: go module_type: filter base_iris: - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_ - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_ - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO If you wish to customise your import entirely, you can specify your own ROBOT command to do so. To do that, add the following to your repo config ( src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml ): import_group: products: - id: ro - id: go module_type: custom Now add a new goal in your custom Makefile ( src/ontology/nfdicore.Makefile , not src/ontology/Makefile ). imports/go_import.owl: mirror/ro.owl imports/ro_terms_combined.txt if [ $(IMP) = true ]; then $(ROBOT) query -i $< --update ../sparql/preprocess-module.ru \\ extract -T imports/ro_terms_combined.txt --force true --individuals exclude --method BOT \\ query --update ../sparql/inject-subset-declaration.ru --update ../sparql/postprocess-module.ru \\ annotate --ontology-iri $(ONTBASE)/$@ $(ANNOTATE_ONTOLOGY_VERSION) --output $@.tmp.owl && mv $@.tmp.owl $@; fi Now feel free to change this goal to do whatever you wish it to do! It probably makes some sense (albeit not being a strict necessity), to leave most of the goal instead and replace only: extract -T imports/ro_terms_combined.txt --force true --individuals exclude --method BOT \\ to another ROBOT pipeline. Add a component A component is an import which belongs to your ontology, e.g. is managed by you and your team. Open src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml If you dont have it yet, add a new top level section components Under the components section, add a new section called products . This is where all your components are specified Under the products section, add a new component, e.g. - filename: mycomp.owl Example components: products: - filename: mycomp.owl When running sh run.sh make update_repo , a new file src/ontology/components/mycomp.owl will be created which you can edit as you see fit. Typical ways to edit: Using a ROBOT template to generate the component (see below) Manually curating the component separately with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or any other editor Providing a components/mycomp.owl: make target in src/ontology/nfdicore.Makefile and provide a custom command to generate the component WARNING : Note that the custom rule to generate the component MUST NOT depend on any other ODK-generated file such as seed files and the like (see issue ). Providing an additional attribute for the component in src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml , source , to specify that this component should simply be downloaded from somewhere on the web. Adding a new component based on a ROBOT template Since ODK 1.3.2, it is possible to simply link a ROBOT template to a component without having to specify any of the import logic. In order to add a new component that is connected to one or more template files, follow these steps: Open src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml . Make sure that use_templates: TRUE is set in the global project options. You should also make sure that use_context: TRUE is set in case you are using prefixes in your templates that are not known to robot , such as OMOP: , CPONT: and more. All non-standard prefixes you are using should be added to config/context.json . Add another component to the products section. To activate this component to be template-driven, simply say: use_template: TRUE . This will create an empty template for you in the templates directory, which will automatically be processed when recreating the component (e.g. run.bat make recreate-mycomp ). If you want to use more than one component, use the templates field to add as many template names as you wish. ODK will look for them in the src/templates directory. Advanced: If you want to provide additional processing options, you can use the template_options field. This should be a string with option from robot template . One typical example for additional options you may want to provide is --add-prefixes config/context.json to ensure the prefix map of your context is provided to robot , see above. Example : components: products: - filename: mycomp.owl use_template: TRUE template_options: --add-prefixes config/context.json templates: - template1.tsv - template2.tsv Note : if your mirror is particularly large and complex, read this ODK recommendation .","title":"Managing your ODK repository"},{"location":"odk-workflows/RepoManagement/#managing-your-odk-repository","text":"","title":"Managing your ODK repository"},{"location":"odk-workflows/RepoManagement/#updating-your-odk-repository","text":"Your ODK repositories configuration is managed in src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml .

If you are looking to customise imports, like changing the module type, see here . Importing a new term Note: some ontologies now use a merged-import system to manage dynamic imports, for these please follow instructions in the section title \"Using the Base Module approach\". Importing a new term is split into two sub-phases: Declaring the terms to be imported Refreshing imports dynamically Declaring terms to be imported There are three ways to declare terms that are to be imported from an external ontology. Choose the appropriate one for your particular scenario (all three can be used in parallel if need be): Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-based declaration Using term files Using the custom import template Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-based declaration This workflow is to be avoided, but may be appropriate if the editor does not have access to the ODK docker container . This approach also applies to ontologies that use base module import approach. Open your ontology (edit file) in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (5.5+). Select 'owl:Thing' Add a new class as usual. Paste the full iri in the 'Name:' field, for example, http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_50906. Click 'OK' Now you can use this term for example to construct logical definitions. The next time the imports are refreshed (see how to refresh here ), the metadata (labels, definitions, etc.) for this term are imported from the respective external source ontology and becomes visible in your ontology. Using term files Every import has, by default a term file associated with it, which can be found in the imports directory. For example, if you have a GO import in src/ontology/go_import.owl , you will also have an associated term file src/ontology/go_terms.txt . You can add terms in there simply as a list: GO:0008150 GO:0008151 Now you can run the refresh imports workflow ) and the two terms will be imported. Using the custom import template This workflow is appropriate if: You prefer to manage all your imported terms in a single file (rather than multiple files like in the \"Using term files\" workflow above). You wish to augment your imported ontologies with additional information. This requires a cautionary discussion. To enable this workflow, you add the following to your ODK config file ( src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml ), and update the repository : use_custom_import_module: TRUE Now you can manage your imported terms directly in the custom external terms template, which is located at src/templates/external_import.owl . Note that this file is a ROBOT template , and can, in principle, be extended to include any axioms you like. Before extending the template, however, read the following carefully. The main purpose of the custom import template is to enable the management off all terms to be imported in a centralised place. To enable that, you do not have to do anything other than maintaining the template. So if you, say currently import APOLLO_SV:00000480 , and you wish to import APOLLO_SV:00000532 , you simply add a row like this: ID Entity Type ID TYPE APOLLO_SV:00000480 owl:Class APOLLO_SV:00000532 owl:Class When the imports are refreshed see imports refresh workflow , the term(s) will simply be imported from the configured ontologies. Now, if you wish to extend the Makefile (which is beyond these instructions) and add, say, synonyms to the imported terms, you can do that, but you need to (a) preserve the ID and ENTITY columns and (b) ensure that the ROBOT template is valid otherwise, see here . WARNING . Note that doing this is a widespread antipattern (see related issue ). You should not change the axioms of terms that do not belong into your ontology unless necessary - such changes should always be pushed into the ontology where they belong. However, since people are doing it, whether the OBO Foundry likes it or not, at least using the custom imports module as described here localises the changes to a single simple template and ensures that none of the annotations added this way are merged into the base file . Refresh imports If you want to refresh the import yourself (this may be necessary to pass the travis tests), and you have the ODK installed, you can do the following (using go as an example): First, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then, you regenerate the import that will now include any new terms you have added. Note: You must have docker installed . sh run.sh make PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B Since ODK 1.2.27, it is also possible to simply run the following, which is the same as the above: sh run.sh make refresh-go Note that in case you changed the defaults, you need to add IMP=true and/or MIR=true to the command below: sh run.sh make IMP=true MIR=true PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B If you wish to skip refreshing the mirror, i.e. skip downloading the latest version of the source ontology for your import (e.g. go.owl for your go import) you can set MIR=false instead, which will do the exact same thing as the above, but is easier to remember: sh run.sh make IMP=true MIR=false PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B Using the Base Module approach Since ODK 1.2.31, we support an entirely new approach to generate modules: Using base files. The idea is to only import axioms from ontologies that actually belong to it . A base file is a subset of the ontology that only contains those axioms that nominally belong there. In other words, the base file does not contain any axioms that belong to another ontology. An example would be this: Imagine this being the full Uberon ontology: Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124 Axiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123 Axiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123 The base file is the set of all axioms that are about UBERON terms: Axiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123 Axiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123 I.e. Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124 Gets removed. The base file pipeline is a bit more complex than the normal pipelines, because of the logical interactions between the imported ontologies. This is solved by _first merging all mirrors into one huge file and then extracting one mega module from it. Example: Let's say we are importing terms from Uberon, GO and RO in our ontologies. When we use the base pipelines, we 1) First obtain the base (usually by simply downloading it, but there is also an option now to create it with ROBOT) 2) We merge all base files into one big pile 3) Then we extract a single module imports/merged_import.owl The first implementation of this pipeline is PATO, see https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/blob/master/src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml. To check if your ontology uses this method, check src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml to see if use_base_merging: TRUE is declared under import_group If your ontology uses Base Module approach, please use the following steps: First, add the term to be imported to the term file associated with it (see above \"Using term files\" section if this is not clear to you) Next, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then refresh imports by running sh run.sh make imports/merged_import.owl Note: if your mirrors are updated, you can run sh run.sh make no-mirror-refresh-merged This requires quite a bit of memory on your local machine, so if you encounter an error, it might be a lack of memory on your computer. A solution would be to create a ticket in an issue tracker requesting for the term to be imported, and one of the local devs should pick this up and run the import for you. Lastly, restart Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and the term should be imported in ready to be used.","title":"Update Imports Workflow"},{"location":"odk-workflows/UpdateImports/#update-imports-workflow","text":"This page discusses how to update the contents of your imports, like adding or removing terms.

To enable this workflow, you add the following to your ODK config file ( src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml ), and update the repository : use_custom_import_module: TRUE Now you can manage your imported terms directly in the custom external terms template, which is located at src/templates/external_import.owl . Note that this file is a ROBOT template , and can, in principle, be extended to include any axioms you like. Before extending the template, however, read the following carefully. The main purpose of the custom import template is to enable the management off all terms to be imported in a centralised place. To enable that, you do not have to do anything other than maintaining the template. So if you, say currently import APOLLO_SV:00000480 , and you wish to import APOLLO_SV:00000532 , you simply add a row like this: ID Entity Type ID TYPE APOLLO_SV:00000480 owl:Class APOLLO_SV:00000532 owl:Class When the imports are refreshed see imports refresh workflow , the term(s) will simply be imported from the configured ontologies. Now, if you wish to extend the Makefile (which is beyond these instructions) and add, say, synonyms to the imported terms, you can do that, but you need to (a) preserve the ID and ENTITY columns and (b) ensure that the ROBOT template is valid otherwise, see here . WARNING . Note that doing this is a widespread antipattern (see related issue ). You should not change the axioms of terms that do not belong into your ontology unless necessary - such changes should always be pushed into the ontology where they belong. However, since people are doing it, whether the OBO Foundry likes it or not, at least using the custom imports module as described here localises the changes to a single simple template and ensures that none of the annotations added this way are merged into the base file .","title":"Using the custom import template"},{"location":"odk-workflows/UpdateImports/#refresh-imports","text":"If you want to refresh the import yourself (this may be necessary to pass the travis tests), and you have the ODK installed, you can do the following (using go as an example): First, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then, you regenerate the import that will now include any new terms you have added. Note: You must have docker installed . sh run.sh make PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B Since ODK 1.2.27, it is also possible to simply run the following, which is the same as the above: sh run.sh make refresh-go Note that in case you changed the defaults, you need to add IMP=true and/or MIR=true to the command below: sh run.sh make IMP=true MIR=true PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B If you wish to skip refreshing the mirror, i.e. skip downloading the latest version of the source ontology for your import (e.g. go.owl for your go import) you can set MIR=false instead, which will do the exact same thing as the above, but is easier to remember: sh run.sh make IMP=true MIR=false PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B","title":"Refresh imports"},{"location":"odk-workflows/UpdateImports/#using-the-base-module-approach","text":"Since ODK 1.2.31, we support an entirely new approach to generate modules: Using base files. The idea is to only import axioms from ontologies that actually belong to it . A base file is a subset of the ontology that only contains those axioms that nominally belong there. In other words, the base file does not contain any axioms that belong to another ontology. An example would be this: Imagine this being the full Uberon ontology: Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124 Axiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123 Axiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123 The base file is the set of all axioms that are about UBERON terms: Axiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123 Axiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123 I.e. Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124 Gets removed. The base file pipeline is a bit more complex than the normal pipelines, because of the logical interactions between the imported ontologies. This is solved by _first merging all mirrors into one huge file and then extracting one mega module from it. Example: Let's say we are importing terms from Uberon, GO and RO in our ontologies. When we use the base pipelines, we 1) First obtain the base (usually by simply downloading it, but there is also an option now to create it with ROBOT) 2) We merge all base files into one big pile 3) Then we extract a single module imports/merged_import.owl The first implementation of this pipeline is PATO, see https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/blob/master/src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml. To check if your ontology uses this method, check src/ontology/nfdicore-odk.yaml to see if use_base_merging: TRUE is declared under import_group If your ontology uses Base Module approach, please use the following steps: First, add the term to be imported to the term file associated with it (see above \"Using term files\" section if this is not clear to you) Next, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then refresh imports by running sh run.sh make imports/merged_import.owl Note: if your mirrors are updated, you can run sh run.sh make no-mirror-refresh-merged This requires quite a bit of memory on your local machine, so if you encounter an error, it might be a lack of memory on your computer. A solution would be to create a ticket in an issue tracker requesting for the term to be imported, and one of the local devs should pick this up and run the import for you. Lastly, restart Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and the term should be imported in ready to be used.","title":"Using the Base Module approach"},{"location":"odk-workflows/components/","text":"Adding components to an ODK repo For details on what components are, please see component section of repository file structure document .
