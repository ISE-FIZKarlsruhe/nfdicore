# Introduction

The **[National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) initiative](https://www.nfdi.de/)** has seen the establishment of various consortia, each dedicated to developing a research data infrastructure tailored to its respective domain. To facilitate interoperability across these consortia, the NFDIcore ontology has been developed and serves as a mid level ontology for representing metadata about NFDI resources such as individuals, organizations, projects, data portals, etc.  

In line with the NFDI's goals, this ontology has been created to provide a structured framework that enables efficient management, organization, and interconnection of research data across various disciplines. By adhering to established data standards, the ontology facilitates the accessibility, sharing, and reuse of research data in a consistent and sustainable manner.

Te key feratures of the NFDIcore ontology are:

* **Representation of NFDI Structure:** The ontology models the organizational structure of NFDI, including its components, projects, services, and partnerships.

* **Referencing Partner Data:** It enables the description and reference of data from various NFDI project partners, providing a unified framework for organizing and linking research data across disciplines.

* **Standardization and Interoperability:** By adhering to data management standards, the ontology ensures that data from different sources can be interconnected, shared, and reused.


Recognizing the diverse needs of consortia, NFDIcore establishes mappings to standards across domains, including the [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://basic-formal-ontology.org/) and [schema.org](https://schema.org/), which is crucial for advancing knowledge representation, data exchange, and collaboration across diverse domains. To answer domain-specific research questions, NFDIcore is extended following a modular approach, as e.g. with the culture ontology module [CTO](https://gitlab.rlp.net/adwmainz/nfdi4culture/knowledge-graph/culture-ontology), matwerk ontology module [MWO](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/nfdi-matwerk/ta-oms/mwo), etc.

Aligning with [IAO](https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/IAO) and [SCHEMA](https://schema.org/), NFDIcore focuses on describing 3 main concepts:

*  Digital Information Artifacts (nfdicore:Resource), e.g. data sets, data portals, publications, services, 
software, etc. 

*  Independent Continuants that act autonomously, e.g. organizations, persons

* Planned processes and events, e.g. projects, contribution and publication processes, events.
