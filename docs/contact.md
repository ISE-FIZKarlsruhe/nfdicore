# How to contact the NFDIcore Team

Every Thursday at 10:00 the NFDIcore team meets and discusses the development of the ontology and its extensions in the NFDIcore Playground. Questions about specific modeling decisions can be discussed in the NFDIcore [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/nfdicore/discussions). [Github issues](https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/nfdicore/issues) can be used to report errors or to request additional classes and properties. For general questions about NFDIcore and for participation in the Playground, please email [Tabea Tietz](mailto:tabea.tietz@fiz-karlsruhe.de).
